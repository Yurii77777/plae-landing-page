                    <p class="about-section__paragraph">
                        Previously a Designer for Puma and Adidas, Head Designer
                        Ryan Ringholz has started a new revolution in kids
                        trainers. Using technology usually reserved for elite
                        athletes, Plae creates shoes designed especially for a
                        child’s foot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-section__paragraph">
                        Because kids feet are always growing, their shoes should
                        accommodate leaving the cartilage and fledgling bone
                        room to grow its own way. The interchangeable tabs
                        adjust to accommodate thinner, wider or thicker feet and
                        nearly all Plae shoes can fit an AFO orthotic brace.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-section__paragraph">
                        With their dynamic traction, little feet can feel the
                        ground beneath them and get a grip on it. The rest is
                        designed to elite athlete standards: super shock
                        absorption, durable toe guards, and wicking, washable
                        anti-microbial inserts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-section__paragraph">
                        With every shoe, Plae sources responsible, recycled, and
                        non-toxic materials, and makes sure

                        They are really light which means I run faster. I like
